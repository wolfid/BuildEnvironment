rc2cpp.bat is a script that converts a <PLUGIN_RESOURCE>.rc file
into a configuration <PLUGIN_RESOURCE>.cpp file
suitable for the Notepad++ Build Environment Plugin.

The plugin name is derived from <PLUGIN_RESOURCE>.

Dialog configuration structure names are derived from the CAPTION sections of the rc file.

COMBOBOXes are used to indicate the current value of respective environemt variables.

A COMBOBOX ID must be of the form:

ID_<VAR_NAME>_<TYPE>BOX

Where <VAR_NAME> is a 6 character environment variable name
and <TYPE> which is a 1 character COMBOBOX type of which 3 are supported:

C) Normal text entry;
F) File entry;
D) Directory entry;

For file and directory entries an associated button is required to be called:

ID_<VAR_NAME>_BTTN

For directories any drive letter is extracted and stored in the environment variable
<VAR_NAME> with the last 3 characters of the name replaced by the characters DRV.
